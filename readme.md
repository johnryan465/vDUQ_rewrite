# Purpose

This is a rewrite of vDUQ from scratch to ensure that I fully understand all aspects of the paper and am competent with pytorch.

vDUQ combines an inducing point GP trained with variational optization for inducing points with deep kernel learning.

This can all be launched in a docker container
